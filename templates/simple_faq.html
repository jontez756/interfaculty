        question: "I forgot my password. What should I do?",
        answer: "Click on the 'Forgot Password?' link on the login page. Enter your email address and you'll receive a password reset link within minutes. Check your spam folder if you don't see it."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I apply to multiple faculties at once?",
        answer: "No, applying to multiple faculties simultaneously will result in automatic disqualification. You may only submit one active application at a time."
    },
    {
        question: "How will I receive my new admission number?",
        answer: "Once the Registrar approves your transfer, the new admission number will appear in your student dashboard and you'll receive a notification."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after Dean approval?",
        answer: "After the Dean approves your application, it moves to the Registrar for final review. The Registrar will issue a new admission number and complete the transfer."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after HOD approval?",
        answer: "After HOD approval, your application moves to the Dean of your requested faculty for review. The Dean will check your KCSE results and qualifications."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I track my application status?",
        answer: "Yes! Your student dashboard shows the current status of all your applications with color-coded badges (pending, approved, rejected, completed)."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does the approval process take?",
        answer: "The complete process typically takes 5-7 working days, depending on the availability of HODs, Deans, and the Registrar."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the requirements for transfer?",
        answer: "You must have completed at least one year in your current program and meet the KCSE requirements for your desired program."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I apply for a faculty transfer?",
        answer: "Log in to your student dashboard and click on 'Apply for Transfer' in the Quick Actions sidebar. Fill in your KCSE details and submit."
